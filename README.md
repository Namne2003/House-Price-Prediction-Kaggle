# House-Price-Prediction-Kaggle
* House Price Prediction Challenge on Kaggle: Predicting the prices of houses given a set of attributes
using the correlation matrix for feature selection, the matplotlib library, and seaborn for visualization
such as histogram and bar charts to see how prices change according to each attribute. Finally, using
KNN regressor, Decision Tree regressor, and Sklearn linear regression algorithms to predict prices,
which resulted in KNN outperformed the other 2 algorithms.
